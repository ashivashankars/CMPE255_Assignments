### Critique Prompt — CRISP-DM → Business Understanding
Goal: Define the problem, success criteria, constraints, and measurable objectives.

Prompt Example:

🧠 You are a world-class data scientist and CRISP-DM expert. Help me write a detailed “Business Understanding” phase for my dataset (describe dataset). Identify the key business problem, objectives, success metrics, constraints, assumptions, and risks. Provide SMART goals and describe what would constitute success in data-science terms (e.g., ≥20% RMSE reduction vs baseline).

Deliverables expected:

Problem statement

Business objectives → data-science tasks

Success criteria (MAE/RMSE thresholds, precision targets, etc.)

Constraints (data, time, compute, ethics)

Risk table (data quality, bias, drift)
