### Critique Prompt — CRISP-DM → Data Preparation
Goal: Clean, transform, engineer, and format data for modeling.

Prompt Example:

🧹 Apply the “Data Preparation” phase of CRISP-DM on this dataset. Implement missing-value imputation, categorical harmonization, ordinal encodings, outlier handling, feature scaling, feature selection, and dataset splits (train/test). Explain each decision with justification and create a preparation log table summarizing every rule.

Deliverables expected:

Cleaned dataset

Transformation rules (imputation, encoding, scaling)

Feature selection rationale

Data preparation log

Reproducible preprocessing pipeline
