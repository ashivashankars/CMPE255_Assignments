This is likely because the `min_cluster_size` of 2 was too low or the `min_samples` was too restrictive for the small dataset and the distinct groupings I expect. Given that I anticipate three main themes, each with three documents, I will adjust `min_cluster_size` to 3. This will encourage HDBSCAN to find clusters with at least three members, which aligns with the expected structure of the data.\n",
